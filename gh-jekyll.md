# Creating a web-site on Git-Hub pages using Jekyll

  1. Create a GitRepo and make basic Jekyll web-site following [this link](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-jekyll-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/).   
  2. To add a custom domain, enter it on the settings page - this will create CNAME file. 
  3. DNS record configurations: for the [apex domain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/#configuring-a-records-with-your-dns-provider), for the [www subdomain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-www-subdomain/).  The CNAME record can point to username.github.io (for the user website) or to the apex name (if we want www and apex to redirect to the same).
